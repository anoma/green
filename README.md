# Anoma

This is an implementation of the Anoma protocol, whose specs can be
found [here](https://specs.anoma.net/latest).

## Following Development

Work is merged into `base` on a bi-weekly (once every two weeks)
schedule.

Development can be followed in multiple ways:

1. [Issues are put into the project overview](https://github.com/orgs/anoma/projects/19)
   - This is a good way to see what work is assigned and the various
     views into how goals are being met
2. [What's Cooking on Anoma](https://github.com/orgs/anoma/projects/20 "A good view on how topics are progressing throughout a cycle")
3. [Research Forums](https://research.anoma.net/)
   - This is good for seeing discussions on the direction of Anoma
   - [The architecture posts](https://research.anoma.net/tags/c/protocol-design/25/architecture)
     in particular are a practical vision for how the codebase's
     architecture will evolve. Around two of these get posted per week
4. [Issues](https://github.com/anoma/anoma/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/anoma/anoma/pulls)
   - This is good for viewing new issues and work coming in, but the
     other views are typically a better way to view this

## Dependencies

To have a working Anoma Node the following dependencies are required:

1. `cmake`
2. `Erlang`
3. `Elixir`
4. `zig`
5. `rust` version of 1.76.0 or newer
  - rustup is an easy way to satisfy this.

### OSX

```sh
brew install elixir
brew install zig
```

### Linux

All the dependencies can be grabbed from your distro's package manager.

## Installation

To install the dependencies as well as Anoma run:

```bash
mix deps.get
mix compile
```

To start an Anoma instance run one of these:

```bash
iex -S mix # starts an interactive shell
mix run --no-halt # starts a non-interactive shell
```

See the Contributing section for how to get the best use of the
interactive shell.

Further see the Known issues section if you encounter an issue.

## Contributing

Please read the [contributor's guide](./documentation/contributing.livemd) for in
depth details about the codebase.

## Known Issues

### (Mix) Could not compile dependency :enacl

For some versions of OSX (and Linux), our
[enacl](https://github.com/jlouis/enacl) package may have compilation issues.

To get around it please run

```sh
git checkout mariari/no-libsodium
mix clean
mix deps.get
mix compile
```

### could not compile dependency :cairo, "mix compile"

The rust compiler can be quite picky about our
[cairo](https://github.com/anoma/aarm-cairo) dependencies. This is
likely caused by an incompatible rust-toolchain.

To get around it you may have to run a command like:

```sh
rustup toolchain add 1.76.0
# for OSX you may try 1.76.0-aarch64-apple-darwin
```

Once this is had, the Cairo issues should go away.

### Git

This codebase follows a git style similar to
[git](https://git-scm.com/) or
[linux](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git).

New code should be based on `base`, and no attempt to keep it up to
sync with `main` should be had. When one's topic is ready, just submit
a PR on github and a maintainer will handle any merge conflicts.

There are bi-weekly releases, so do not be afraid if a maintainer says
the PR is merged but it's still open, this just means that it's merged
into `next` or `main` and will be included in the next scheduled
release.

For more information on a smooth git experience check out the [git
section in contributor's guide](./documentation/contributing/git.livemd)

Happy hacking, and don't be afraid to submit patches.
